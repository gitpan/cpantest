To install the script and man pages in the standard areas, 
give the sequence of commands

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

If you want to install the script in your own private space, use

  perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/my/private/perllib \
       INSTALLMAN1DIR=/my/private/perllib/man/man1 \
       INSTALLMAN3DIR=/my/private/perllib/man/man3      
  make
  make test
  make install

Note that `make test` currently does nothing useful.
